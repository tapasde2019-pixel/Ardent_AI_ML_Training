## 📌 Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Titanic dataset** to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival. It also serves as a hands-on introduction to core Python programming concepts and data visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and inspect a real-world dataset using **Pandas**
- Understand the structure, data types, and statistical properties of the data
- Detect and handle **missing values**
- Perform basic **survival analysis** across different passenger groups
- Create meaningful **visualizations** using Matplotlib
- Practice core Python fundamentals alongside data science workflows

## 📂 Dataset

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Titanic Passenger Dataset |
| **Source** | [datasciencedojo/datasets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv) |
| **Rows** | 891 |
| **Columns** | 12 |

### Key Features

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Survived` | Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) |
| `Pclass` | Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) |
| `Sex` | Gender of the passenger |
| `Age` | Age in years |
| `SibSp` | Number of siblings/spouses aboard |
| `Parch` | Number of parents/children aboard |
| `Fare` | Ticket fare paid |
| `Embarked` | Port of embarkation (C, Q, S) |

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** — data loading, manipulation, and analysis
- **Matplotlib** — data visualization and plotting
- **NumPy** — numerical operations
- **Google Colab** — development environment

---

## 📋 Project Workflow

### Step 1 — Import Libraries
Import `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and other required libraries.

### Step 2 — Load Dataset
Read the Titanic CSV directly from a public GitHub URL using `pd.read_csv()`.

### Step 3 — Understand the Data
- Inspect shape, column names, and data types with `df.info()`
- Generate descriptive statistics using `df.describe()`
- Preview the first few rows with `df.head()`

### Step 4 — Handle Missing Values
Identified missing data in three columns:

| Column | Missing Values | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| `Age` | 177 | Filled with mean age |
| `Cabin` | 687 | Left as-is (too many missing) |
| `Embarked` | 2 | Filled with mode |

### Step 5 — Simple Analysis
- Counted survival distribution: **549 did not survive**, **342 survived**
- Analyzed survival rates by gender and passenger class

### Step 6 — Visualizations
Created charts including:
- Bar charts for survival counts
- Line plots for pulse vs. calorie burnage (Sports Watch dataset demo)
- Additional plots demonstrating Matplotlib's flexibility

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- The overall survival rate was approximately **38.4%**
- Significant disparities existed in survival rates across **passenger class** and **gender**
- The `Cabin` column had over **77% missing data**, making it unsuitable for direct analysis
- `Age` had ~20% missing values, imputed using the mean (~29.7 years)

## 🐍 Python Concepts Practiced

This notebook also covers Python fundamentals as part of the learning journey:

- **Built-in modules**: `math`, `datetime`
- **Control flow**: `for` loops, `while` loops, nested loops
- **String methods**: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.index()`
- **User-defined functions**: defining, calling, parameters vs. arguments

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

### Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Project_1__EDA_.ipynb"
   ```
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.

> **Note:** The dataset is loaded directly from a public URL — no manual download required.
